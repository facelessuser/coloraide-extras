FIX : Handle divide by zero case for Weber contrast by setting a more reasonable max. 1.0.post1 FIX : Remove beta notices from documentation. 1.0 NEW : Update to support the official ColorAide stable release. Move to a \"stable\" release for ColorAide Extras. 1.0rc1 NEW : Move the Color object which contains all plugins to coloraide_extras.everything.ColorAll . This will prevent instantiating things that some users may not care about. NEW : Plugins are no longer available root of package, but must be imported from their location: coloraide_extras.<plugin_type>.<space>.<class> . FIX : Clamp luminance in Michelson and Weber contrast plugins to zero if negative luminance. FIX : Adjust some color space ranges to be more reasonable. 1.0b1 NEW : Add support for new ColorAide 1.0 Beta. NEW : All previous color spaces except UCS and UVW have been moved to ColorAide 1.0 Beta. NEW : Added CAM16 UCS, CAM16 LCD, and CAM16 SCD and an associated cam16 \u2206E. NEW : Added Weber contrast and Michelson contrast. 0.5.1 FIX : Fix Hunter Lab values. 0.5.0 NEW : Update to support ColorAide 0.16.0 changes. 0.4.0 NEW : Added oRGB color space. 0.3.0 NEW : Updated to work with ColorAide 0.15.0 (now the required minimum) as there were substantial changes. NEW : Added support for RLAB color space. 0.2.0 NEW : Updated to work with latest ColorAide. FIX : IPT and IgPgTg mismatched channel association ( p <=> t ). This also broke round trip conversions. 0.1.2 FIX : Fix UVW calculation when u = v = w = 0 . 0.1.1 FIX : Fix some divide by zero cases in some of the color spaces.

Part of the reason for its creation is to help improve color distancing. CAM02, which CAM16 is based off of and meant to improve, specified 3 color spaces: UCS, LCD, and SCD. LCD and SCD are particular for large scale and small scale color differencing respectively. Our implementation of CAM16 also implements UCS, LCD and SCD color spaces and provides a color distancing method called cam16 which utilizes the aforementioned color spaces. By default the method utilizes the CAM16 UCS color space, but if magnitude is specified with either lcd or scd , the appropriate CAM16 LCD or CAM16 SCD color space will be used instead (assuming all required color spaces are registered).

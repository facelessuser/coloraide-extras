    Test round trip conversions of all color spaces.

    A color that does not round trip back likely has a broken conversion.
    It may be possible that some color spaces degrade through conversion,
    but the currently supported spaces have enough integrity when performing
    a round trip to meet the required value at the default precision.

    There are certain values they may not round trip exactly. Hues may become
    null, etc. But we are picking general colors that should round trip well
    enough.

    # Except for black, it can be very difficult to get perfect round tripping
    # on achromatic colors unless we do absolutely no hue adjustments near achromatic.
    # Many algorithms do not exactly land on what is expected for achromatic. For
    # instance CIELab rarely resolves to `a = b = 0` except in the case of black.
    # For cylindrical spaces that pass through a Lab-like spaces during conversion,
    # you can often get wild hues near achromatic values because the saturation or
    # chroma never quite gets to zero. In these case, we often set hue as undefined when
    # chroma or saturation is very close to zero. But, when we pass through multiple
    # spaces that do this, we can get a compounding error near achromatic colors making
    # it difficult to get perfect round tripping with achromatic values.

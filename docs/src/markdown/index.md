# Introduction

!!! warning "Currently a Prerelease"
    Like [ColorAide](https://github.com/facelessuser/coloraide), ColorAide Extras is very usable and out of the alpha
    stage, but it is currently in a prerelease state. This simply means that the API of ColorAide is still in flux to
    some degree and could affect this package.

ColorAide Extras is an add-on pack containing various plugins for [ColorAide](https://github.com/facelessuser/coloraide).
ColorAide only ships with a select number of color spaces, âˆ†E methods, and gamut mapping alternatives. ColorAide Extras
allows us to offer an additional number of uncommon and/or experimental set of color spaces and other plugins.

## Installation

The recommended way to install ColorAide Extras is to use `pip`:

```console
$ pip install coloraide_extras
```

## Usage

Normally, it is advisable to only cherry pick color spaces you need. Rarely do people need every color space. This can
be done simply by registering the color spaces you'd like.

```playground
from coloraide_extras import Color
Color('color(--ucs 0.27493 0.21264 0.12243 / 1)')
```

But, if you want access to all the color spaces for both ColorAide and ColorAide Extras, simply import `Color` from
`coloraide_extras` instead of `coloraide`:

```playground
from coloraide import Color as Base
from coloraide_extras import UCS
class Color(Base): ...
Color.register(UCS)
Color('red').convert('ucs')
```
